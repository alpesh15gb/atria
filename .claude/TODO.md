# TODO

## Next

- [x] **Editor screens revamped (2026-09-26):** shared EditorShell chrome
      (exit ✕ / title / Save & New / Save + sticky totals panel on desktop,
      `editor_shell.dart` + `editor_totals.dart`); sale editor gained Save &
      New, Mark-as-fully-paid settlement on save, dashed Add-Item strip,
      collapsible Notes/Charges; purchase editor same treatment; item/party/
      expense got the EditorAppBar. Tests `editor_shell_test.dart` (2).
      Suite 69/69, analyzer clean.
- [x] **List screens revamped (2026-09-26):** shared transaction toolkit
      (`transaction_list.dart`: TotalsCard, search field, unified rows with
      kebab actions, desktop table grid); sales/purchase/expenses rebuilt on
      it; convert-to-invoice from quote/order rows; expenses search + Net-P&L
      card; shared Period pills everywhere. Goldens regenerated. 67/67.
- [ ] Golden teardown: dashboard/settings captures hang after writing their
      PNG (pre-existing, capture-only; others settle). Investigate drift
      stream teardown on those two screens when convenient.
- [x] **Android "route /onboarding/firm-setup does not exist" fixed
      (2026-09-26):** single app-lifetime router with `/boot` splash route
      (park-and-resume relaunch locations, refreshListenable pulse), branded
      recoverable 404 page; bonus fix: firm-setup no longer a dead end once a
      firm exists ("Add another business" worked before). Root cause was the
      boot-router swap meeting Android's restored launch route. Regression:
      `test/router_boot_regression_test.dart` (gate-held executor). 67/67.
- [x] **Vyapar-inspired feature pass (2026-09-26):** credit/debit/delivery
      notes (tabs + editors + numbering), recycle bin with guarded
      delete-forever, CSV export with BOM, payment reminders with WhatsApp
      nudge, barcode label PDFs, schema v2 migration. Fixed: build_runner
      zero-builder pubspec trap, stale-snapshot numbering race.
      64/64 tests, analyzer clean.

- [x] **Missing features & UX pass (2026-09-26):** expense/income editing
      (route + editor + tappable rows), real WhatsApp deep-link share, item
      delete & duplicate, quotation/order → invoice conversion with converted
      status, stock adjustment dialog, per-tab sales FAB label, Ctrl+S on all
      editors, shared PeriodPillRow with ripple, unused deps removed.
      56/56 tests, analyzer clean.

- [ ] Rebuild + install debug APK on the Android device to confirm the route
      fix on hardware (pure-Dart change; gradle surface untouched).
- [ ] Release builds: `--release` for Windows and APK (APK needs a signing config;
      the template signs with debug keys today).
- [ ] `git init` — the project is still not version-controlled.
- [ ] The three `*_plus` plugins still apply the Kotlin Gradle Plugin; a future
      Flutter will refuse `build apk` until they migrate to built-in Kotlin.

## Later

- [ ] Cloud sync is deliberately relabelled EXPERIMENTAL, not implemented. If/when the
      user wants it real: add `Supabase.initialize` + a worker draining `sync_queue`
      (all 7 entities already enqueue insert/update/delete), and revert the Settings copy.
- [ ] Remove stale repo-root artifacts (`analyze*.txt`, `test_out.txt`, `build_out.txt`,
      `HANDOFF.MD`, `LEFTOFF.MD`, `status.md`).
- [ ] Fix remaining deprecations noted in `status.md` (`withOpacity` -> `withValues`).

## Completed

- [x] **Bug hunt finished (2026-09-26).** Every CRITICAL and HIGH item in
      `.claude/memory/bugs.md` is fixed and regression-tested: invoice/purchase
      edit corruption, double stock deduction, per-line tax never persisted,
      invoice discount double-count, boot-failure recovery, unsaved-changes
      guards on all four editors, GSTIN validation, dashboard KPI staleness,
      cancelled-invoice chip, editor/footer totals mismatch.
      `dart analyze lib/` clean; `flutter test --exclude-tags golden` 44/44.
- [x] Eyeball all 6 light-mode goldens — dashboard, sales, parties, items, reports,
      settings all render legibly (2026-09-25). Regenerated after the blue rebrand.
- [x] Relabel Cloud Sync "EXPERIMENTAL / Coming soon" in Settings at the user's request —
      the toggle persisted a flag nothing reads, which was the one fake feature left (2026-09-25).
- [x] Stop the golden suite failing `flutter test`: `@Tags(['golden'])` on `library;` +
      `exclude_tags: golden` in `dart_test.yaml` + a 2-minute per-test timeout (2026-09-25).

## Completed (earlier)

- [x] Add persistent Claude Code memory.
- [x] Add 128k-safe context recovery workflow.
- [x] Fix all 67 compile errors across 11 files (2026-09-24).
- [x] Clear all analyzer warnings — `flutter analyze` reports no issues (2026-09-25).
- [x] Verify `flutter test` passes — now 22/22 with goldens excluded by default.
- [x] Unblocked all native builds: vendor-patched phosphor_flutter, fixed Android
      compileSdk 36 + Kotlin incremental cache issue (2026-09-25).
      `build windows --debug` and `build apk --debug` both succeed.
- [x] Fix "Get Started"/"Skip" doing nothing — root cause was a `FutureProvider`
      onboarding flag the router redirect cached forever, which made *every* button
      in the app look dead (2026-09-25). Now synchronous `StateNotifier` state.
- [x] Fix opening stock double-counting in `ItemRepository.create` (2026-09-25).
- [x] Rebrand primary colour green -> blue across theme, logo, PDF, avatar palettes
      (2026-09-25).
- [x] Light-mode contrast fixes: overdue-hero gradient no longer fades to pale pink
      under white text; `outline` strengthened from 1.23:1 to ~1.7:1 (2026-09-25).
- [x] Test coverage 11 -> 22: onboarding redirect regression tests, persistence
      round-trip tests for parties/items/sales/purchases/expenses, light-mode goldens
      (2026-09-25).
